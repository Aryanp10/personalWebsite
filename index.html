       <b>Hi! My name is Aryan Parajulee, and currently I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Houston focusing on Software Engineering/Machine Learning.</b>
    </p>
      <p class="space" id="introduction" align="justify">
       My sole focus for now is to attain an internship for the upcoming Summer 2021 that promotes critical thinking and fosters the development of technical skills in a professional environment. I have good experience with C++, Python, HTML, CSS, R. I am truly excited for my hunt of this internship as it will be my first step into the professional world.
      </p>
      <p class="space" id="introduction" align="justify">
       So far I have had great passion and excitement for programming and plan to increase my knowledge more through projects, conferences, hackathons and internships. So far I've done only two of the four things mentioned, but I am trying my hardest to check all the four pillars to be prepared for the professional world. Machine learning and Artificial intelligence have always fascinated me greatly. In the future I plan on taking such courses that involve those things so I can have experienced everything that I am interested in. My work experience might not be related to my studying field but I can assure that I have gained valuable lessons and technical skills that will undoubtedly be useful for my career and work space.
